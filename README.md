# CNC Milling Tool (Tool Wear Detection)
## Project Overview
### Project Details
In this project machining data was collected from a CNC machine for variations of tool condition, feed rate, and clamping pressure.

In 18 machining experiments, time series data was collected with a sampling rate of 100 ms from the 4 motors in the CNC (X, Y, Z axes and spindle).
### Goal
The main goal of the project is to find the best model to predict the machine failure.
